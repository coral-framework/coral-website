Originally developed for use in a real-time 3D engine, Coral has evolved into a portable, lightweight, general-purpose C++ component framework.

# History
{: .page-header}

Coral was created at [Tecgraf/PUC-Rio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUC-Rio) in 2010 and announced as an open-source project in 2014. Its design was influenced by [COM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model), [CORBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA), [OSGi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi), [.NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET), [Qt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) and other projects---but especially by [Lua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))'s _balanced minimalist design_.

Coral's design favors [simplicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(computing)), [mechanisms over policies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_policy), and [convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) whenever possible---but it's not very opinionated, it's a low-level framework on top of which opinionated frameworks can be built.

# Mission
{: .page-header}

We want to make [architectural styles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Architecture_styles_and_patterns) easy and attractive to use in C++, with a framework optimized for programmer happiness, sustainable productivity, and minimal overhead.

We are always looking for ways to make Coral simpler and more powerful. In the future we would like to turn it into a general-purpose _code generation engine_ that could be used for [MDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering) and [AOSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_software_development).
